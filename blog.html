                <h2>Wednesday, 13 October 2021</h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to start with the blog to write a bit about the current state of the project and also shed some light to the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before doing it, let me recap how it all started. I mentioned it slightly in <a href="about.html">About</a> page. 
                    Actual development work started a week or two back with a <a href="snake.html">Snake in 5 minutes</a> idea.
                    It went surprisingly well and I really enjoyed this idea and thought "wow, that quite fun and can be really exciting". 
                    Uploaded a video to YouTube under my personall account, shared via LinkedIn, got some feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also while working on a Snake game I realized that I have a number of different projects in my mind that can be also done in 5 minutes or faster. That's how I decided to start this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What are my goals? I don't know now... But in reality I have around 20 mini-projects in pipeline and I want to make 20 'X in 5 minutes' videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also today I'm publishing my 6-th video - this time it will be about viral <a href="2048.html">2048 game</a>. Hope you enjoy it.
                </p>
