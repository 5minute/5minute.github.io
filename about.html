                <h2>About this project</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to show people that it is possible to create mini-project in under 5 minutes.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Project's focus is:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prove that programming is not that complex</li>
                        <li>Showcase quick 5 minutes mini-projects</li>
                        <li>Bring value to developers, especially those who are starting their journey</li>
                        <li>Use as less 3-rd party libraries and frameworks as possible</li>
                        <li>Share all solutions for free via GitHub repository - <a href="https://github.com/5minute/examples">https://github.com/5minute/examples</a></li>
                        <li>Share live-coding screen recording for building the solution - all avaiable on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoa8IHQyqtYkHhsOZ4XpHaw">5 minutes of code<a/> YouTube channel</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, these items are not primary project's focus:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clean code - often solutions are built with focus on speed rather on readability</li>
                        <li>Fully working solutions - for example while implementing classic game like "Snake" don't expect that it will be feature-complete</li>
                        <li>Teach you programming - I believe there are lots of other useful resources</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>About me</h2>

                <p>
                    My name is Sergey and I've been developing and architecting solutions for over 18 years for the clients all over the globe.
                    Sometimes I feel that I need to break out from enterprise world and have some fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why I decided to start this project and indeed have some fun and share my knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea came when I recalled a story from my school time - a classmate challenged me if I can do a "Snake" game in 40 minutes. I did it within 25 or so minutes. <br/>
                    After 20 years I was explaining my kids how does "making computer programs" look like. And I also chose "Snake" game. <br/>
                    And then I thought - "Hm, can it be done faster? For example in 5 minutes?". I realized that there are lots of impressive things that can be coded in 5 minutes or less.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite working on this project in my free time as a hobby (or a pet?) project I have lot's of ideas what else can be coded in 5 minutes.
